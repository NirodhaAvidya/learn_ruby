This is the completed projects based on Alex Chaffee's Test-First Ruby (http://testfirst.org).

For my purposes labs 13 & 15 were optional, but I completed them and have included them in a folder labeled extra_credit.

Additionally, labs 3 & 8 call for an additional file (little_words.txt) nested in a folder named assets.  While the relative path is functional on my windows machine, I'm not certain if it will work on other operating systems.
